# Misc-ESP8266-Projects
Collection of Arduino IDE sketches for various ESP8266-based projects

Much of the time, I find it's necessary to modify example files before they work for me. This repo is a place for me to preserve and share my modifications. 

## Licensing Note
I generally develop under either MIT, BSD or Artisitic license, using the MIT license here. This licensing applies to my changes only. Please note that the original code I started with may have originated under a GPL or other license, which will usually be noted in the source file. What a world we've made!
